# SNHU-CS230-REPO

# Project Summary:
  This project centers around a mock request from a client called The Gaming Room who would like the team (me) to design a cloud-based web application called "Draw It or Lose It". This game is a simple guessing game in which teams take turns attempting to guess the subject of a stock image that is slowly revealed over the course of a round. 

# Strengths & Where I Can Improve:
  I feel that at this moment my primary strength is my ability to write concise and digestable information that clearly conveys the essence of the project without being overly-technical or dull. With this sort of design document, I believe that this sort of writing is essential as it serves more of a product pitch than a technical overview. This leads into what I believe needs improvement. At this point in my studies, I believe that my limited practical experience with technologies like cloud computing are holding me back from the quality of work that I am certain I could reach. This limited experience currently hinders my ability to adequately and thoroughly speak on some of the topics covered in this project. I am determined to resolve this lack of experience throughout the remainder of my studies.

# Helpful Design Aspects & What I Will Apply In The Future:
  As someone who had previously been fond of spontaneous development, working on this project and other coursework has convinced me that thoroughly planning and gathering techincal requirements is the ideal way to approach software development. Having these requirements gathered has significantly aided in university/personal development projects as it has reduces bloat and provides clear functionality goals to strive for. 

# User Needs (& Why They Are Important):
  When designing any commercial product, user consideration is arguably the most important factor to ensure some level of success. Any product that fails to capture user needs has no room in crowded markets such as driver education, therefore designing such products should hone in on what users want that is not being provided. In this instance, the company wants to capture an audience by providing a greater level of flexibility to students through online lessons and in-vehicle lessons at times/locations designated by the student.
